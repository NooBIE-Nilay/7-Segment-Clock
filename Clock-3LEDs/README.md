# Digital Clock with Arduino & NEOPIXEL WS2812B LEDs and RTC Module

![Digital Clock](clock_image.jpg)

This project folder contains the necessary code and documentation for building a digital clock using Arduino, NEOPIXEL WS2812B LEDs, and an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module. The clock displays the current time with vibrant LED animations and is perfect for adding a creative touch to your living space or workspace.

## Components Required

To build the digital clock, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- NEOPIXEL WS2812B RGB LEDs
- RTC module (e.g., DS3231, DS1307)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
- Power supply (e.g., USB cable, battery pack)

## Circuit Diagram

Before proceeding with the code, make sure to connect the components according to the following circuit diagram:


## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to install and set up the digital clock:

1. Clone or download this project folder to your local machine.

2. Connect the Arduino board, NEOPIXEL WS2812B LEDs, and RTC module as per the circuit diagram.

3. Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer and open the `digital_clock.ino` file from the `src` directory of this project.

4. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for the RTC module and NEOPIXEL LEDs. If not, you can download them using the Arduino Library Manager.

5. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

6. Upload the code to the Arduino board.

7. Once uploaded, the digital clock will start displaying the current time on the NEOPIXEL LEDs.

## Usage

The digital clock is straightforward to use. The NEOPIXEL LEDs will display the current time in a visually appealing manner. You can place the clock in a suitable location and power it on. The RTC module ensures accurate timekeeping even when the Arduino is powered off.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the clock to suit your preferences and creativity. You can modify the LED animations, colors, brightness, and other visual aspects by tweaking the code. Experiment with different patterns and effects to create your unique digital clock design.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the digital clock, consider the following:

- Double-check the connections between the components and ensure they match the circuit diagram.

- Verify that you have uploaded the correct code to the Arduino board.

- Make sure the required libraries are installed and up to date.

- If the clock is not displaying the correct time, check the battery backup or power supply for the RTC module.

- Refer to the documentation of the Arduino board, NEOPIXEL LEDs, and RTC module for troubleshooting specific issues.
